      Paneer, also known as panir, is a fresh acid-set cheese common in Indian
      cuisine. It&#39;s made from full-fat buffalo milk or cow milk, curdled
      with lemon juice or other acids. This non-melting, unaged cheese is used
      in various dishes, including curries and sweets

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 gallon milk</li>
      <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 cup canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Step-1: </b>Pour milk into a large pot and bring to a boil over
        medium heat; watch carefully to prevent milk from boiling over. When
        milk begins to boil, pour buttermilk into the pot in a steady stream,
        stirring constantly. The milk will separate into curds and water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step-2: </b>Line a colander with cheesecloth. Pour milk mixture
        through the cheesecloth, reserving some of the strained liquid. Let milk
        mixture sit in the colander until curds are settled and dripping stops,
        about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step-3: </b>Transfer strained curds to a food processor. Process
        until smooth and mixture can be formed into a ball. Add some of the
        reserved liquid and process again if mixture is too dry. The consistency
        should resemble firm ricotta cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step-4: </b>Turn cheese out onto a clean surface and knead until
        smooth. Form into a ball and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step-5: </b>To cook paneer, heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over
        medium-high heat. Cut paneer into bite-sized pieces. Fry in hot oil
        until very pale golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a paper
        towel-lined plate.

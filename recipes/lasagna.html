    <p>
      Easy lasagna is a comforting and flavorful dish that requires minimal
      effort. It typically consists of layers of lasagna noodles, a rich meat
      sauce (often made with ground beef or turkey), and a creamy cheese
      mixture. The cheese layer is a combination of cottage cheese, mozzarella,
      Parmesan, eggs, and seasonings. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until
      bubbly and golden. Serve it with a side of roasted asparagus, garlic
      knots, or a fresh arugula-fennel salad for a satisfying meal. Leftovers
      can be refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for longer storage. Enjoy!
